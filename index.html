                    <p>INORA is a perfume brand that blends timeless elegance with global influence. 
                        Inspired by Kolkata, each fragrance combines notes like Mediterranean citrus, 
                        Middle Eastern amber, Madagascar vanilla, and Indian jasmine, creating a unique 
                        sensory experience. More than just a scent, INORA evokes emotions and memories, 
                        offering a subtle yet lasting impression of sophistication and allure.
